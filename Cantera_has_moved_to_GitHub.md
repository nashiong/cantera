# Cantera has moved to Github #
Since Google Code is being shut down, Cantera's source code, wiki, issue tracker, and downloads have been migrated to a new home on Github:

  * https://github.com/Cantera/cantera
  * https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/wiki
  * https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/issues
  * https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/releases

This transition to Github includes a change in the version control system used for Cantera, from Subversion to Git. If you previously accessed the Cantera source code using Subversion, you will need to check out a new copy of the source code using Git. If you are new to Git, Github provides some instructions:

> https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

If you previously used git-svn or the git-svn mirror hosted on Github, you will need to take some additional steps to update your existing repository. Instructions are available at:

> https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/wiki/WorkingWithGit

Current documentation is available at:

> http://cantera.github.io/docs/sphinx/html/index.html
